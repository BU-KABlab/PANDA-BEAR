To prepare the vial caps, print the vial cap file 16mm (https://github.com/BU-KABlab/PANDA-BEAR/blob/11926d87ccea33a8cf2bb2a00a704f83ab7a6db5/documentation/3D-prints/VialCap/VialCap16mm.step) using 0.2 mm layer height with the default print profile in Bambu Studio. Decreasing the speed by 25% can help if you have issues with the recessed area geometry.

Prepare PDMS in a ratio of 10:1 base:crosslinker using ~2.6 mL of PDMS for each cap (there is a slightly recessed fill line in the print on the interior of the cap). 

Allow PDMS to cure for a minimum of 48 hours (make sure it's not tacky before use). You can rinse with water repeatedly until it is no longer tacky if it doesn't cure after 2 days.

Place adhesive backed ferrous metal discs (25mm diameter, 0.5mm height) in recessed area, if the adhesive isn't strong enough, you can use super glue for a more secure hold. (Example of discs you can use: https://www.amazon.com/Metal-inch-Replacement-32-Mini/dp/B0CJZ7SLJN/)

Ensure metal disc is FLUSH with top of cap (i.e., no areas sticking up slightly more than others)

Caps are only reusable for the same composition solution (e.g., water caps can be reused for water)

Some solutions will degrade caps faster than others, ensure caps can be easily removed by hand before starting a campaign.
