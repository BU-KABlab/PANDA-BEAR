# PANDA-BEAR Wiki

![PANDA Logo](../PANDAlogo.png)

Welcome to the PANDA (Polymer Analysis and Discovery Array) wiki! This wiki provides comprehensive documentation for both end users and developers working with the PANDA system.

## What is PANDA?

PANDA is an open-source self-driving lab developed by the [KABLab](https://www.kablab.org/) at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/). The PANDA electrodeposits and functionally characterizes polymer films using a combination of electrochemical and optical techniques in a novel well plate architecture.
