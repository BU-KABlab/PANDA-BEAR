## Experiment Framework for CNC Mill, Electrode, and Pipette

### 1. Hardware Integration
- Ensure proper connection and integration of the CNC mill, electrode, and pipette with the control system.
- Establish communication interfaces between the control system and the mill, electrode, and pipette devices.
- Set up sensors or feedback mechanisms to monitor and control mill, electrode, and pipette movements accurately.

### 2. Control Software
- Develop or utilize existing control software to interface with the CNC mill, electrode, and pipette.
- Implement functionalities for precise control of mill movements, including position control, speed control, and tool changes.
- Provide control capabilities for the electrode, such as positioning, voltage control, and current measurement.
- Implement pipette control features, including liquid handling operations (dispensing, aspirating), volume control, and precise positioning.

### 3. Experiment Management
- Design a framework to define and manage experiments, allowing researchers to specify experimental parameters, sequences, and conditions.
- Provide an interface or configuration file for users to define the sequence of mill, electrode, and pipette operations required for each experiment.
- Include functionalities to handle different types of experiments, such as milling patterns, electrodeposition, solution exchanges, and pipetting tasks.

### 4. Data Logging and Analysis
- Develop mechanisms to log and store experimental data, including mill movements, electrode potentials, current measurements, and pipette volumes.
- Implement data analysis tools to process and interpret collected data, enabling researchers to extract meaningful insights and draw conclusions from the experiments.
- Consider integrating visualization capabilities to generate plots, graphs, or visual representations of experimental results.

### 5. User Interface
- Create a user-friendly interface for researchers to interact with the system, define experiments, monitor progress, and visualize results.
- Provide intuitive controls for manual operations, such as controlling mill movements, electrode potentials, and pipette actions.
- Include a dashboard or status display to provide real-time feedback on the system's status, ongoing experiments, and any errors or warnings.

### 6. Safety Measures
- Implement safety features to prevent collisions, tool breakages, or any hazardous situations during the experiments.
- Consider incorporating error detection mechanisms, emergency stop buttons, and safety interlocks to ensure the well-being of users and equipment.
